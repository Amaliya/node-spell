Hi! This is my first node.js extension. :-)

NOTE: This libhunspell binding for node is currently the Minimal Viable Product of software.

The dictionary files you need and a working example are in test/

You will probably need to modify the 'Hunspell * pMS= new Hunspell();' line
if you need to support different languages or want to change the path of the dictionary files.

This will be fixed soon.

You will need the hunspell library and hunspell-devel installed.

Make sure the path in ./wscript is correct as well.

Routines:

Currently, node-spell only has one very simple function called quickspellcheck(). It accepts a string with one word in it as a parameter.

If you need to spellcheck text with multiple words in it, you will need to loop through each word, checking it with quickspellcheck(). See example in test/

Compiling:

node-waf configure && node-waf build

Your needed module will be in build/default/
